## Revised autocorrelation descriptors

Inspired by https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.7b08750. Currently only working on complexes with CN/NN type ligands. Could accommodate more. Much more experiments are needed. 

Details in calculation are slightly different from their version. All algorithms are rewritten. No important dependency.

Will include other descriptors only when the existing implementation is not clearly documented.
