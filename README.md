## Revised cheminformatics descriptors
This repo is about revised cheminformatics descriptors. They are revised as in being defined with customized specifications such as scope, distance, elemental or other roperties, etc.

### Revised autocorrelation descriptors

Inspired by https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.7b08750. Currently only working on complexes with CN/NN type ligands. Could accommodate more. More experiments are needed. 

Details in calculation are slightly different from their version. All algorithms are rewritten. No important dependency.

Working on including other common autocorrelation descriptors. Might draw ideas from conventional 2D autocorrelation descriptors.
