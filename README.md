# Revised molecular descriptors
Commonly used descriptors in cheminformatics revised. They are revised as in being defined with customized specifications such as scope, distance, elemental or other roperties, etc.

## Revised autocorrelation descriptors

## Moreau-Broto styled autocorrelation
Inspired by https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.7b08750. Currently only working on complexes with CN/NN type ligands. Could accommodate more. More experiments are needed. 

Details in calculation are slightly different from their version. All algorithms are rewritten. No important dependency.

## Moran styled and Geary styled autocorrelation
Working on including other common autocorrelation descriptors. Might draw ideas from conventional 2D autocorrelation descriptors.
