## Revised cheminformatics descriptors
This repos is about revised cheminformatics descriptors. They are revised as in being defined with customary specifications such as scope, distance, properties, etc.

### Revised autocorrelation descriptors

Inspired by https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.7b08750. Currently only working on complexes with CN/NN type ligands. Could accommodate more. Much more experiments are needed. 

Details in calculation are slightly different from their version. All algorithms are rewritten. No important dependency.

### Revised Auto2D descriptors

work in progress
